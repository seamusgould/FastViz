# NewsVisualization

This web application was made using react, javascript, recharts, and basic css and html.

A simple web application where users can track sentiment across headlines.  When a search query is made, a user can quickly view the sentiment of the articles written about the headline.

Take for instance, monkeypox, which whas gained traction very recently as the number of cases is rising.  In addition, the visualization shows that the sentiment of those articles are generally negative.

On the other hand, coronavirus sentiment has been fairly constant/stationary and the number of articles that deal with the subject has not changed drastically.

Here are examples of some recent headlines (5/23/22):
